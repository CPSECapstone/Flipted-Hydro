FliptEd is a web-based learning management system based on gamification and mastery learning. Flipted seeks to incorporate modern educational strategies into a learning platform for schools. These strategies chiefly include the concepts of gamification and mastery learning.

Our application focuses on the student side of flipt.ED, providing a way for students to access and complete course content, and track their progress.

## Architecture

 Our frontend was built with React, and uses the Apollo Client library to communicate with our GrahpQL backend API.
 
 The backend is GraphQL API hosted in Amazon Web Services. The code for the backend lives on a separate repo: https://github.com/CPSECapstone/flipted-backend
